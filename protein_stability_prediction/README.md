# Protein Stability Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting protein stability changes (ΔΔG) upon single-point mutations using supervised machine learning models. The goal is to provide a computational alternative to experimental stability assessment.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Publicly available protein mutation datasets
- Input features derived from protein sequence and mutation information
- Output: ΔΔG (protein stability change)

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering using sequence-based properties
- Model training (Regression models)
- Model evaluation using R², RMSE, MAE

---

## 📈 Results
The models demonstrated the ability to capture trends in protein stability changes, with ensemble models showing improved performance.
